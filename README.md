# senneku 

Senneku is a file uploading and sharing application made in Rails and designed
to keep your files private. You can set your files to be deleted if their link
is indexed on Google, after a certain period of time, or after a certain number
of clicks.

Development is still very early, partially due to the main dev (me) still
learning Rails in its entirety. However, as I learn more things and get more of
the base application done, things should start picking up.

In addition, this is being developed concurrently with my other Rails webapp,
[babel](http://www.github.com/jayc0b0/babel), which will both help and hinder
development of this one.
